Social-Media-App
================

A first attempt at creating a social media app using parse

You will first need a parse app id and master key to get any use out of the app. 

The app is based off the swiffer tutuorial by Brian Advent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6kTw_cK3zY

I built off it and added a profile page, intro page, and menu animation. 
Menu animation provided by GitHub user Yuji Hato,I adopted his animation scipt and slightly added changes
